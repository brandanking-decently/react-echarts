# Introduction

[ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html) is is an incredible
open-source library that empowers users with robust charting and visualization
capabilities. It provides a seamless experience with its intuitive, interactive,
and highly customizable charts.

While there are existing wrappers for ECharts in the React ecosystem, we noticed
a lack of implementations that truly embraced the core concepts of React. Hence,
our primary goal was to create a user-friendly React component that effortlessly
exposes the vast range of ECharts functionalities through props. By doing so, we
aimed to simplify the process of utilizing ECharts within a React project while
ensuring flexibility and ease of use.
