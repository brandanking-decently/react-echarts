# Performance

While in most cases extra renders in React are not a problem, in some cases they
can be. For example, if you are loading many charts on screen and heavy updating
them, as this could lead to performance problems.

If you are defining props inside a component, you should still try to give them
a stable identity. **Store the props definitions in either a `useMemo` or
`useState` hook.** This will help with performance and prevent unnecessary
re-renders.

```tsx
import { EChart, EChartProps } from '@kbox-labs/react-echarts'
import { useMemo } from 'react'

const staticProps: EChartProps = {
  xAxis: {
    type: 'category'
  },
  yAxis: {
    type: 'value',
    boundaryGap: [0, '30%']
  }
}

function App() {
  const series = useMemo(
    () => [
      {
        type: 'line',
        data: [
          ['2022-10-17', 300],
          ['2022-10-18', 100]
        ]
      }
    ],
    []
  )

  return <EChart {...staticProps} series={series} />
}
```
