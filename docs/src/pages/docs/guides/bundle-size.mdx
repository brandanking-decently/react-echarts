# Bundle Size

  By default, and unless the `use` prop is specified all source code of ECharts
  is included.

Controlling bundle size is crucial for optimizing the performance of your
application. **By default, all source code of ECharts is included.**
Nonetheless, you can leverage the tree-shakeable interface offered by ECharts by
using the `use` prop.

## The `use` prop

In the context of React ECharts, you have the flexibility to include only the
necessary components by utilizing the `use` prop.

For a more tailored approach, you can leverage the tree-shakeable interface
offered by ECharts. This allows you to selectively bundle the required
components, resulting in a more streamlined and minimal bundle size.

```tsx
import { EChart } from '@kbox-labs/react-echarts'
import { BarChart } from 'echarts/charts'
import { LabelLayout } from 'echarts/features'
import { CanvasRenderer } from 'echarts/renderers'
import {
  TitleComponent,
  TooltipComponent,
  GridComponent
} from 'echarts/components'

function App() {
  return (
    <EChart
      use={[
        BarChart,
        TitleComponent,
        TooltipComponent,
        GridComponent,
        CanvasRenderer
      ]}
      // ...your other props
    />
  )
}
```

This approach enhances the efficiency of your application by excluding
unnecessary code and dependencies.
